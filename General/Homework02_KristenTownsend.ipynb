    "Part (a) I did step by step. I first set up input for the variables $A$ and $Z$, and then established all my constants. Determining $a_5$ was a little tricky, but I did it with a little logic tree and the modulo operator. Last I just calculated the binding energy with *the big equation* from the book and printed the results.\\\n",
    "Part (b) just took an extra step to calculate $B / A$.\\\n",
    "To help me with part (c), I turned the calculations for B and the little logic tree for $a_5$ into a user-defined function that took $A$ and $Z$ as arguments. I then called that within another function to find the most stable mass number $A$. The function also had a while loop and nested if statement to iterate from the input value $Z$, reassigned to $A$, to $3Z$. On each iteration of the while loop I had it calculate the binding energy per nucleon, and used the if statement to determine if it was the strongest one yet. Once all the iterations of $A$ completed, the strongest binding energy per nucleon and corresponding mass number were returned and printed.\\\n",
    "Part (d)! I set up a for loop to run through all values of atomic number $Z$ from $1$ to $100$. On each loop, it runs the function that determines the strongest binding energy per nucleon and corresponding mass number, and the results were printed. I was also once again keeping track of the strongest bind per nucleon value and its corresponding mass number, and printed them once the for loop had completed. The atomic number matches the expected value of $28$ given in the book!"

    "Temperature conversions! I started by building my test list of Celsius temperatures, and set up a user-defined function that takes a single input. Within the function I initialized an empty list to hold the converted values, and had an iteration that repeated for however many elements long the input list was. Within the for loop was where the actual calculation was done, and the results were appended into the empty list. I then printed the results that were returned when the function was called with the input Celsius values."

    "Mapping this problem out was pretty tricky for me. I set up my list of primes containing only $2$ to begin with, as the book requests, and then created a for loop to check each number from $1$ to $10,000$. All the numbers were assumed to be prime unless they could be cleanly divided by a number between $3$ and the square root of the number in question. If not, the number remains as a prime and was appended to the list of primes.\n",
