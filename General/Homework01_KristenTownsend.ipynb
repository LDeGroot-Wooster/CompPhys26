Gamma needed for the relativistic nonsense was easy to calculate because I had the velocity from the beginning."

    "To start off, I did this whole problem on paper before even trying to code anything, which was super helpful when deciding what to do with my code. I got my input variables setup and set some general constants I would need later. I was having major difficulty typin out the entire quadratic formula for $v_2$, so I split the formula up into $b_{quad}$ and $c_{quad}$. This made the quadratic so much easier.\\\n",
    "Once I got $v_2$ figured out, the rest of the calculations I was able to just pull from the book and type out pretty easily, with of course an extra conversion at the end so the orbital period was given in years instead of seconds. Seconds are cool to know, but not exactly what I was looking for! I put all of my print statements and the end because I figured it was better if they were all together? I don't know what the proper 'coding etiquitte' for print statements is."
