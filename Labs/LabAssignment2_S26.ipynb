    "I began by defining an array of heights from 0m to 50m, going up by 0.5m at every value (being to have the second value be 50.1 as to include 50, and also to define it as a float). Then, I used an input to ask the user for a mass in kg. Next, I calculated the potential energy using the formula $p_e=mgh$ where $p_e$ is potential energy, $m$ is the mass (given by user) $g$ is gravity ($10 m/s^2$) and $h$ is the height of the object at a specific height (given by our array of heights). By using this equation, it creates an array of all of the potential energies of an object at the given heights wihtin the array. I then calculated the kinetic energy using the equation $k_e = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ where $k_e$ is the kinetic energy, $m$ is the mass (given by the user), and $v$ is velocity at a specifc point. The velocity at a certain point can be found usig the equation $v^2=V_0^2+2ax$. $V_0$ is initial velocity, which is 0 $m/s^2$, a is acceleration from gravity ($10 m/s^2$), and x is the distance the object has traveled (which in this case is 50m minus the array of heights.) Using these equations, we are then given an array of all the kinetic energies of the object at a specifc height (given by our array of heights.) The I printed all of my results"
