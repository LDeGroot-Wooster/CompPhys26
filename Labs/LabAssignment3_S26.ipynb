Before calling the function, I stored the start time, and then I called the function by printing the sum, and then I printed the current time using a code I found by rogeriopvl on StackOverflow. The code uses the %s command within a string to replace part of the string with a calculation, which I thought was very clever. I took his code, where the start time was subtracted from the time.time() at the point of the print statement, and I multiplied that value by 1000 to produce the time in milliseconds."
